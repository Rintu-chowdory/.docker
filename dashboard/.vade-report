# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the kali-dashboard React + Vite project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new dependency

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.jsx**:
  - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react"`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the main App component (before closing `</div>` tags)
  - Removed unused `useCallback` import to fix linting error

## Implementation Details

Following the guide for React (create-react-app pattern), the Analytics component was added to the main App component in `src/App.jsx`. This is a wrapper around the tracking script that provides seamless integration with React.

**Note**: The plain React implementation does not have automatic route support, but the Analytics component will track page views and custom events as documented in the Vercel Analytics documentation.

## Verification

✅ Build successful - no compilation errors
✅ Linting passed - only pre-existing warning (unrelated to changes)
✅ Dependencies installed correctly
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab → Enable)
2. Deploy the app using `vercel deploy` or via Git integration
3. Verify tracking by checking browser Network tab for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard after users visit the site

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment to Vercel.
